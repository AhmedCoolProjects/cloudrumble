Kubernetes and Docker Swarm Code Examples

I highly recommend checking out

- [Collabnix Github - Dockerlabs](https://github.com/collabnix/dockerlabs) for excellent Docker tutorials and exercises.

- [Collabnix Github - Dockerlabs](https://github.com/collabnix/kubelabs) for excellent Kubernetes tutorials and exercises.

## Lab Setup

### Kubernetes

All kubernetes examples can be done using free [Kubelab - Play With Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/).

Follow instructions in [This guide](https://github.com/collabnix/kubelabs/blob/master/kube101.md) and setup 3 nodes cluster. 1 master and 2 worker nodes

> [!ATTENTION]
> The guide asks to setup 5 nodes but for our purposes 3 are more than enough.

### Docker Swarm

All Docker Swarm examples can be done using [Kubelab - Play With Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/).

Follow instructions in [This guide](https://github.com/collabnix/dockerlabs/blob/master/intermediate/swarm/README.md) and choose 3 Managers and 2 Workers setup form instance templates.
