# Examples and Exercises Setup <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

The goal is to explain Kubernetes and Docker Swarm topics in a practical way, like storage, deployments, services etc and provide exercises scenarios for everyone to follow along.

The idea is to focus on the core functionality, understand it well enough and exercise along.

If you already watched a few tutorials and maybe created pod or deployment and are ready for next level, those exercises are for you.

If you are new do Kubernetes, but still would like to follow along with the series I highly recommend checking out [Kubernetes Tutorial for Beginners [FULL COURSE in 4 Hours]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X48VuDVv0do&ab_channel=TechWorldwithNana) from TechWorld with Nana

## Example Files

Exercises and sample code is located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/Piotr1215/dca-exercises). You can either clone it and work directly from command line or use `kubectl` with remote location of a file or folder you want to deploy.

## Structure

Each topic will follow the same structure:

1. How does it work?
2. What Problem does it solve?
3. How to implement it?
